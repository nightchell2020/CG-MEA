      "INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside at 9:54 a.m. using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was somnolent and not entirely cooperative.\n",
      "DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG transitions between stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and K-complexes, as well as a drowsy pattern.  In drowsiness there is an increase in alpha frequency activity.  In this bedside recording in this patient who persists on lying on his left side, there is some artifacts in the posterior scalp region.  The technologist attempts to obtain the patient's cooperation with little success.  Arousals produce eye opening.  The patient then drifts off to sleep.  On one or 2 occasions there is a suggestion of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm before he drifts off to sleep.  POSTS were noted in sleep.\n",

The hypersomnolence is an anticipated finding after seizures and a repeat study when the patient is able to come to the lab may be helpful in characterizing epileptiform activity.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz 55 mV alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.\n",
